ChangeLog for QCADesigner-2.0.3-modified
Bug Fixes:
 -- fixed segmentation fault at startup on newer versions of ubuntu linux
 -- fixed bug where .po files would fail to compile on some unix systems
 -- fixed bug where the coherence vector simulator would not correctly stabalize
 -- fixed bug where the bistable approximation simulator would not converge fully yielding incorrect results
 -- fixed bug where the bistable approximation simulator would not correctly shuffle the cell order when the "randomize cell order" is enabled
 -- fixed bug where attempting to open the simulation type dialog window would cause a crash
 -- fixed bug where elements were not being removed from expanding arrays properly leading to segmentation faults
 -- fixed potential memory leak when performing multiple simulations in a row
 -- fixed various GTK critical warnings

Improvements:
 -- improved coherence vector simulation speed by 310%
 -- improved bistable approximation simulation speed by 500-700%

Changes:
 -- the "randomize cell order" option for the coherence vector simulator is now redundant
 -- layers imported from blocks now maintain their order
 -- the bistable simulator now sends only a fraction of its samples to the simulation data (like the coherence vector simulator)
 -- Both simulators now scale the number of samples recorded with the number of inputs

ChangeLog for next release -- 1.3.

Completed Changes/Bug Fixes/Additions:

 -- Started gtk2 port (available via the gtk2 tag: cvs co -r gtk2 QCADesigner)

 -- Created gtk2 version of the scrolling message widget, because under
    GTK2 multiline text is done waaaay differently.  Factored out the 
    process of writing messages to the widget into a printf()-like 
    function.
 -- Save first boxes added.
 -- Digital Simulation engine made available.
 -- Created new vector table library and struct to replace old vector_table and
    active_inputs structures.
 -- Moved all simulation engines to this new vector table structure
 -- Removed globals "vector_table" and "active_inputs" and their respective
    structures
 -- Created new user interface for specifying vector tables
 -- Added basic Undo/Redo capabilities for creating cells
 -- Fixed clipping bug occurring with toolbar pixmaps
 -- Rotate cells now can rotate all selected cells if they are selected prior
    to pushing the rotate button.
 -- Added view menu item to remove pixmaps from the toolbar. Useful feature
    for small screen laptops.
 -- Mirror cells now mirrors all the properties of the cells including type and
    input/output names.
 -- Added menu item under tools to rotate block of selected cells by 90 degrees.
 -- Added Hotkeys for "Increment Cell Clocks" (Ctrl+I)

Desired Changes:

Bugs to Fix:
-- Some weird vector table behaviour with the bistable engine

Long Range Changes:
 -- XML File format (tdysart currently working on)
